    <p style="font-family: arial;text-align: justify;">
    <p>Many people use the terms <b>Internet</b> and the <b>World Wide Web</b> interchangeable, but in fact, the two
        terms
        are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two separated but related things.</p>

    <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of
        computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with other computers as
        long as
        they are both connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of languages
        called
        <i>"Protocols"</i>.
    </p>

    <p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> or simply <i>"Web"</i>, is a way of accessing information over the medium of the
        internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the internet. The Web usb <b>HTTP
        protocol</b>,only one of the languages spoken over the internet, to transmit data.</p>
